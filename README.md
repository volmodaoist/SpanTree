Give a star ‚≠ê. Let's make it better!



## üòé Introduction
Hello there, fellow QA engineers and test development colleagues! We've put together this little helper called SpanTree, which is essentially a Python library. You're probably all too familiar with the situation: when we're in the thick of project work, we frequently have to write test scripts based on those trace files (mostly in JSON format) that get generated during runtime. And making assertions on key-value pairs is a regular task. But, as you've likely experienced, these key-value pairs often sit within complex hierarchical structures. Before we knew it, our code was filled with multiple layers of nested dictionaries, forcing us to use a ton of square brackets just to access the specific values we needed. What's more, any changes the R&D team makes to the code can really throw off the hierarchy of those key-value pairs, making our test script maintenance a bit of a headache. So, we thought we'd give it a shot and create something that might ease this pain a little. That's how SpanTree came to be. It's by no means a perfect solution, but we're hoping it'll prove useful and save you some hassle in your day-to-day work.



## üí° Concept of SpanTree 
Imagine this scenario: the trace of a project, grounded in its call relationships, can be conceived of and visualized as a tree structure. Each node in this tree represents what we call a ‚Äúspan‚Äù. In simple terms, a span is a node that contains the information produced by the operation of each service. And interestingly, each span is represented as a JSON object, and a JSON object itself can be regarded as a tree. So, in essence, SpanTree is like a structure of ‚Äútrees within trees‚Äù. We kind of stumbled upon this concept while trying to find a better way to handle the hierarchical data that was constantly tripping us up in our testing efforts. It might seem a bit tricky to grasp at first, but we believe that as you use it more, it'll start to make sense and hopefully make your work a bit easier. 





## üõ†Ô∏è Core Functional Implementation

Alright, so SpanTree's main functionality is brought to life by the following two functions:

### Inter Span Constraint

The `_recursive_inter_search` function is designed to help you navigate through the span tree:

- **Function Description**: It recursively searches for the `target_span_name` within the span tree. The `target_span_name` supports the '.' constraint, which can be quite handy when you're trying to pinpoint a particular span within that often-confusing tree structure. 

- **Usage Explanation**: Once you expand the entire set of spans, it forms a tree. Imagine you're walking from the root node to the leaf nodes, and the names of the spans form a path like `'span1.span2.span3.span4.span5.span6'`. In this case, the `target_span` can be a non-contiguous subsequence of this path, for example, `'span_name1.span_name3.span_name5'`. By using this path, you can locate the span corresponding to the `span_name`. Additionally, if the `is_type` parameter is set, the search will be conducted using the span type instead of the name. 

### Inner Span Constraint

The `_recursive_inner_search` function is focused on exploring within a single span:

- **Function Description**: It recursively searches for the `target_key` within a single span. The `target_key` also supports the '.' constraint. The `idx` parameter is useful for `List[Dict]` structures, allowing you to target only the fields within the `idx`-th `Dict` element. 

- **Usage Explanation**: Each span, when you look inside it, also forms a tree-like structure. Suppose you're traversing from the root node to the leaf nodes within a span, and the names of the keys form a path like `'key1.key2.key3.key4.key5.key6'`. Then, the `target_key` can be a non-contiguous subsequence of this path, such as `'key1. key3. key5'`. Through this path, you can find the value corresponding to `key5`. 





##  üß∞ Key Functions for Users
###   Function `retrive`

This function is one of the key tools in the SpanTree arsenal for retrieving specific data. It takes advantage of both the inter and inner constraints to make it easier for you to access the values you need. For example:

```python
res1 = spantree.retrive(target_span_name='root.father_span_1.leaf_span_1', 
                        target_field='data.message')
res2 = spantree.retrive(target_span_name='root.leaf_span_1', 
                        target_field='data.message')
res3 = spantree.retrive(target_span_name='root.leaf_span_1', 
                        target_field='message')
```

With a simple call to this function, you can efficiently navigate through the complex tree structures and obtain the desired values. We've aimed to make it as straightforward as possible, but we're aware that everyone's use cases can vary. If you have any difficulties or ideas for improvement, don't hesitate to reach out. 



### Function  `batch_retrive`

When you need to retrieve multiple values from different parts of the SpanTree simultaneously, the `batch_retrive` function comes in handy. You can configure it with appropriate settings to fetch a variety of data in one go. This is especially beneficial for comprehensive testing scenarios where multiple aspects need to be verified at once. However, we understand that the configuration might seem a bit daunting at first, so if you need any help or have questions about how to use it best, just let us know. 





## Usage Example üìù

Here's a more detailed look at how you can use SpanTree with some sample data. First, let's consider the following `spans` structure represented in JSON:

```json
{
  "spans": [
    {
      "name": "root",
      "type": "root",
      "span_id": "1",
      "parent_id": "0",
      "state_code": 0,
      "data": {
        "message": "This is the root span.",
        "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "father_span_1",
      "type": "father",
      "span_id": "2",
      "parent_id": "1",
      "state_code": 0,
      "data": {
        "message": "This is a sub span under root.",
        "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:10Z"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "leaf_span_1",
      "type": "leaf",
      "span_id": "3",
      "parent_id": "2",
      "state_code": -1,
      "data": {
        "message": "This is a leaf span under father_span_1.",
        "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:15Z"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "father_span_2",
      "type": "father",
      "type": "father",
      "span_id": "5",
      "parent_id": "1",
      "state_code": 0,
      "data": {
        "message": "This is a sub span under root.",
        "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:30Z"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "leaf_span_2",
      "type": "leaf",
      "span_id": "6",
      "parent_id": "5",
      "state_code": -1,
      "data": {
        "message": "This is a leaf span under father_span_2.",
        "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:35Z"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

You can use the `retrive` function on this data quite easily. For instance:

```python
res1 = spantree.retrive(target_span_name='root.father_span_1.leaf_span_1', 
                        target_field='data.message')

res2 = spantree.retrive(target_span_name='root.leaf_span_1', 
                        target_field='data.message')


res3 = spantree.retrive(target_span_name='root.leaf_span_1',
                       target_field='message')

# res1, res2, res3 have the same value in this eaxmple.
```

Now, let's expand our example further. Consider a more complex `spans` structure:

```json
{
    "spans": [
        {
            "name": "root",
            "type": "root",
            "span_id": "1",
            "parent_id": "0",
            "state_code": 0,
            "input": {
                "param_str": "123",
                "param_int": 123
            },
            "output": [
                {
                    "result_key": "root_result_value, idx = 0",
                    "sub_result": [
                        {
                            "sub_key": "root_sub1_value, idx = 0"
                        }
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "result_key": "root_result_value, idx = 1",
                    "sub_result": [
                        {
                            "sub_key": "root_sub_value, idx = 1"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "father_span_1",
            "type": "father",
            "span_id": "2",
            "parent_id": "1",
            "state_code": 0,
            "input": {
                "param_str": "456",
                "param_int": 456
            },
            "output": [
                {
                    "result_key": "father_result_value",
                    "sub_result": [
                        {
                            "sub_key": "father_sub_value"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "leaf_span_1",
            "type": "leaf",
            "span_id": "3",
            "parent_id": "2",
            "state_code": -1,
            "input": {
                "param_str": "789",
                "param_int": 789
            },
            "output": [
                {
                    "result_key": "leaf1_result_value, idx = 0",
                    "sub_result": [
                        {
                            "sub_key": "leaf1_sub_value, idx = 0"
                        }
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "result_key": "leaf1_result_value, idx = 1"
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "father_span_2",
            "type": "father",
            "span_id": "4",
            "parent_id": "1",
            "state_code": 0,
            "input": {
                "param_str": "1011",
                "param_int": 1011
            },
            "output": [
                {
                    "result_key": "father2_result_value",
                    "sub_result": [
                        {
                            "sub_key": "father2_sub_value"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "leaf_span_2",
            "type": "leaf",
            "span_id": "5",
            "parent_id": "4",
            "state_code": -1,
            "input": {
                "param_str": "1213",
                "param_int": 1213
            },
            "output": [
                {
                    "result_key": "leaf2_result_value, idx = 0",
                    "sub_result": [
                        {
                            "sub_key": "leaf2_sub_value, idx = 0"
                        }
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "result_key": "leaf2_result_value, idx = 1"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

And here's how you can use the `batch_retrive` function to handle more comprehensive data extraction:

```python
  configs = {
      "root": {
          "idx": None,
          "is_type": False,
          "target_fields": [
              ("input.param_str", "default_root_param_str", lambda x: x),
              ("input.param_int", "default_root_param_int", lambda x: x)
          ]
      },
      "father_span_1": {
          "idx": None,
          "is_type": False,
      "target_fields": [
              ("input.param_str", "default_father1_param_str", lambda x: x),
              ("input.param_int", "default_father1_param_int", lambda x: x)
          ]
      },
      "leaf_span_1": {
          "idx": 0,
          "is_type": False,
          "target_fields": [
              ("input.param_str", "default_leaf1_param_str", lambda x: x),
              ("input.param_int", "default_leaf1_param_int", lambda x: x),
              ("result_key", "default_result_key", lambda x: x)
          ]
      },
      "leaf_span_2": {
          "idx": 1,
          "is_type": False,
      "target_fields": [
              ("input.param_str", "default_leaf1_param_str", lambda x: x),
              ("input.param_int", "default_leaf1_param_int", lambda x: x),
              ("result_key", "default_result_key", lambda x: x)
          ]
      }
  }
  results = spantree.batch_retrive(configs)
```

In the `batch_retrive` function, `configs` is a crucial dictionary for configuration.

Take a `target_span_name` in `configs` (e.g., `"root"`):
- `idx` (optional): For `List[Dict]` data, set a value to retrieve fields only from the `idx`-th element. If `None`, no index limitation.
- `is_type` (optional): Default is `False`. Set to `True` to match the target span using `[span_name]` as `[span_type]`.
- `target_fields` (required): It's a list of tuples like `(target_field_name, default, callback)`.
  - `target_field_name`: The name of the field to retrieve, e.g., `"input.param_str"`, specifying the hierarchy.
  - `default`: The fallback value if the field isn't found, with a matching type.
  - `callback`: A lambda function to process the retrieved field value.

This way, whether you're using the simple `retrive` function for quick access to specific values or the more powerful `batch_retrive` function for handling multiple data extractions at once, SpanTree provides a convenient and efficient way to interact with hierarchical data. We hope it makes your testing work more efficient and less error-prone, but we're always open to feedback if you think there's something we could do better. After all, we're all in this together to make our testing workflows smoother and more effective! üòÉ 






## üìë Conclusion 
SpanTree is our attempt to simplify the process of handling hierarchical data in test scripts for QA engineers and test development engineers. We've put a lot of thought into its design and functionality, but we know there's still a lot to learn and improve. By leveraging its features and functions, we hope you can focus more on the actual testing logic rather than getting bogged down in complex data access and maintenance issues. If you decide to give it a try in your projects, we'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences. Let's make our testing workflows better together!
